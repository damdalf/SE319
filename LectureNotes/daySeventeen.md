    * **Imagery** - signs, icons, and symbols. From photographically real to abstract designs.

    * **Sound** - abstract, vocal, concrete, or musical cues.
    * **Visual identity** - the additional, unique rules that lend overall consistency to a user interface.
* The fundamental principles of using visible language:
    * **Organize** - provide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure.
        * Consistency, screen layout, relationships and navigability.
    * **Economize** - do the most with the least amount of cues.
        * Simplicity, clarity, distinctiveness, and emphasis.
