# **SE 319 - DAY SEVENTEEN: DESIGNING USER INTERFACES CONTINUED: | 03/23/2022 |**

## **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF VISIBLE LANGUAGE**
* Organize.
* Economize.
* Communicate.

---
## **UI DESIGN ISSUES**
* UI design issues depend on:
    * **Human factors**.
        * *Limited short-term memory.*
            * How many items of information can one remember instanteously?
        * *Familiarity.*
            * Use terms and concepts from the domain (realm) of the application.
        * *Consistency.*
            * Similar / comparable operations should be activated in the same way.
        * *Error recovery and guidance.*
            * Provide meaningful, unambiguous feedback when errors occur.
    * **Interaction styles (to / from the user).**
        * Visualization.
        * Error / warnings.
        * Color (visible language).

## **INTERACTION STYLES**
* Obtaining information from the user:
    * **Direct manipulation.**
        * Advantage:
            * Intuitive interaction.
        * Disadvantage:
            * Hard to implement.
            * Requires visual metaphor.
        * Applications:
            * Games.
            * CAD.
    * **Menu-based.**
        * Advantage:
            * Avoids user error.
        * Disadvantage:
            * Can be slow and / or complex.
        * Applications:
            * Most systems with a GUI.
    * **Form-based.**
        * Advantage:
            * Simple and checkable.
        * Disadvantage:
            * Can be long.
        * Applications:
            * E-commerce.
    * **Natural user interface (NUI):**
        * Advantage:
            * Easy and natural, inuitive interface.
        * Disadvantage:
            * Natural language processing (AI, voice recognition, etc.).
        * Applications:
            * Information retrieval systems / apps.
    * **Command language (CLI interface).**
        * Advantage:
            * Easy to implement.
        * Disadvantage:
            * Hard to understand.
            * Many commands to memorize.
        * Applications:
            * Scripts.
* Presenting information to the user:
    * Direct.
    * Transformed (visualized).

---
## **UI DESIGN PROCESS**
* User analysis.
    * Understand what users will do with the system.
* Prototyping.
    * Develop (many) prototypes.
* Evaluation.
    * Experiment with the prototypes.
