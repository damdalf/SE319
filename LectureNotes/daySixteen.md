# **SE 319 - DAY SIXTEEN: GROUP PROJECT INFORMATION CONTINUED: | 03/19/2022 |**

## **PLANNING GAME**
* Create user stories.
    * Estimate time needed to accomplish user stories.
    * Determine the speed.
        * Speed - points / scores of all finished stories per iteration.
        * Speed changes:
            * Growing experience of the team - increase the speed.
            * Support of the finished subsystems - decrease the speed.
* Selection of the stories:
    * Team selects stories to begin with, based on:
        * Estimated effort.
        * Assumed business value.
        * Speed of the team.

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**
* If a task is causing problems:
    * Discuss problem with the team:
        * New solutions.
        * Change the order of tasks.
        * Group couples again.
    * Inform customers and team members:
         * Delete stories from the iteration.
         * Simplify stories.

---
## **REFACTORING**
* Problems with KIS:
    * Simplicity vs. generality.
* Solution is refactoring:
     * Teams design and revise through refactoring in the course of the project.
        * Include time for refactoring old work when creating time estimates.
    * Refactoring leads to:
        * Removal of duplication.
        * Increaseed cohesion.
        * Reduced coupling.

---
## **CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION**
* Teams keep the system fully integrated at all times.
* Daily, or multiple times a day builds.
* Avoid "integration hell".
* Avoid code freezes.
* Only integrate your functions if all unit tests are passed.

---
## **PAIR PROGRAMMING**
* Code is built by two programmers sitting side by side at the same machine.
    * Pilot & co-pilot.
* All production code is there reviewed by at least one other programmer.
* Research shows that pair programming produces better code within the same efficiency as programming independently. 
* Pairing also communicates knowledge throughout the team.

---
## **COLLECTIVE CODE OWNERSHIP**
* Any pair of programmers can improve any code at any time.
* No secure workspaces.
* All code gets the benefit of many people's attention.
* Avoid duplicate code.
* Programmer tests catch mistakes.
