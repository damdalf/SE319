# **SE 319 - DAY EIGHT: FURTHERING NODE.JS | 02/07/2022 |**

## **NOTES:**
* The biggest thing about Node.js is that is allows us to program an entire web application using JavaScript, and functions asynchronously.
    * Both server and client-side.
* ```==``` - loose equality
    * Only the VALUE of the data matters
* ```===``` - strict equality
    * The TYPE of the data and the VALUE of the data matters.
* Type coercion - two values are compared only AFTER attempting to convert them into a common type.
* ```exports``` - Used to make properties and methods available outside of the specified module.
* callback - a function passed as an argument in another funciton.
