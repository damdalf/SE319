# **SE 319 - DAY FIFTEEN: EVENT-DRIVEN PROGRAMMING FINALIZED AND GROUP PROJECT INFORMATION: | 03/19/2022 |**

* THREADING
    * Drawbacks of single-threaded approach:
        * No vertical scaling by increasing the number of CPU cores of the system.
        * Not good for massive parallel computing.
        * Needs additional module.
    * Mitigation:
        * Developers can increase the default number of threads in the thread pool. 

---

* GROUP PROJECT INFORMATION
    * There will be three iterations, each consisting of two-weeks of work time.
    * We will be developing in a TDD system:
        * Planning Game.
            * Story cards:
                * Customer presents required features.
                * Developers estimate requirements, difficulty, and priority.
                * Revise regularly. 
            * Two-week iterations:
                * Customer presents required features.
                * Programmers break features down into tasks. 
                * Team members can sign up for tasks. 
                * Running software at end of each iteration.
        * Simple Design.
            * KIS - Keep It Simple.
            * UML (unified modeling language) or use-case diagrams become very helpful when organizing the structure of your program and specific tasks.
                * UML: 
                    * Describes the type of objects in the system.
                    * Describes the static relationship among them.
                    * Basic components of class diagrams:
                        * Class name.
                        * Class properties.
                        * Class operations.
                * Use case:
                    * Name.
                    * Actor(s).
                    * Input(s).
                    * Outputs(s).
                    * Flow of events.
                    * Special requirements.
            ---
            * Only build software to accomplish the specified tasks for that sprint (two week duration), do not focus on future tasks.
                * The requirements will change tomorrow, so only do what's needed to meet today's requirements.
            * Do not a force a solution, program the feature to be able of being integrated within a whole program.
        * Testing.
        * Small Releases (every two weeks).
