# **COM S 319: Day Two - Software Production | 1/21/22 |**

## **Aspects of Software Production**
* Gathering requirements
* Design
* Development
* Testing and debugging
* Maintenance
    * The most costly aspect of software production.
        * Maintenance is long term, with potentially changing circumstances. Especially with things like legacy systems, you still have to provide service and updates on increasingly outdated software.
        * Beyond that, it requires the retention of specialist personnel with system specific knowledge.
* What is the goal of software engineering?
    * Produce good and functional software, within the given time-schedule and resource budget.
        * Functional, user-friendly, time-to-market, budget, and resources.
* Criteria for good software:
    * Reliable (few bugs).
    * Efficient (fast).
    * Easy to maintain.
    * Good usability (UI / interaction).
    * Good security.

## **Notes:**
* Single monolithic code tree - single code tree using several different languages.
* All builds from source - meaning that the code is compiled each and every day.
* System software - software that isn't supposed to be seen by the consumers / users (backend).
* Application software - software that the user directly interacts with.

* The application software will require more maintaining as it's life cycle is far longer than the system software and hardware's life cycle, so you will have to adapt it with those changes.

## **Changes in Software in the Last Decade:**
* Increasing importance.
* Growing complexity.
* Growing software in mobile devices (everywhere with different UI's).
* Networking and geographical distribution.
* Increasing quality requirements.
* Increasing standard software.
* Increasing 'legacy code'.
    * Legacy code - outdated code that is still being used.
* Increasing 'off-the-shelf' development.
    * Means you will not implement yourself, but you will implement said feature using another company's module / API / program.
