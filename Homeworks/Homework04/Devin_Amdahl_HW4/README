To compile my solution for this assignment, you will need to import the 
Java project titled 'hw04' that I have included in this 'src' folder. 

Once imported, you will need to change the paths for the 'chromedriver' 
as well as that of the 'validation.htm'l file within the 
'validationTests.java file (which is the only Java file within the 
'hw04' project). The lines for these changes are: 20 & 22.

I have included both of these files within my Java project under the 
folder 'task1', which should make dragging these two files into a folder 
of your choice easy to do. Simply change the paths to correspond to the 
paths of the folder in which you have now placed these files. Once that 
is done, everything should work fine. Please follow a format similar to 
that done already in the 'validationTests.java' file. Ensure that the 
chrome driver path ends in 'chromedriver', and that the validation page
path ends in 'validation.html'. 

After that, simply run the program and both JUnit tests should pass.
